# Homework Tasks

## Task 1

Using the example from homework 3 of lesson 14, implement the ability to connect your namespace and work with `MyDictionary` similarly to an instance of the `Dictionary` class.

### Steps:

1. Create the `MyDictionary` class in the `MyNamespace.Collections` namespace.
2. Implement the basic functionality of a dictionary (adding, removing, searching for values).
3. Use `MyDictionary` in the program similarly to the `Dictionary` class.

## Task 2

Create a class with a method marked with the `public` access modifier. Demonstrate that this method can be accessed not only from the current assembly but also from a derived class in an external assembly.

### Steps:

1. Create a project with a base class that contains a public method.
2. Create another project with a derived class that inherits from the base class.
3. Call the public method from the derived class.

## Task 3

Visit the MSDN website. Using the MSDN search mechanisms, independently find a description of the topic for each example covered in the lesson, as shown below in the "Recommended Resources" section. Save the links and provide a brief description for them.

### Recommended Resources

- [MSDN: Overloading Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/operator-overloading)
- [MSDN: ICloneable Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icloneable)

## Task 4

Create your own namespace `MyNamespace` with the class `MyClass` and connect it to another program.

### Steps:

1. Create a new project and add the `MyNamespace` namespace.
2. Add the class `MyClass` to this namespace.
3. Create another project, connect the `MyNamespace` namespace to it, and use the `MyClass` class.

## Task 5

Study the main constructs and concepts covered in the lesson.

### Key Concepts:

- Namespaces.
- Dynamically Linked Libraries.
- Access Modifiers internal and protected internal.
- Preprocessor Directives.
